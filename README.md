Starter template for a typical Flutter project.

## Getting Started

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

### Changing the Application Name

Because the application was initialized with a placeholder name, `template`, you need to change this manually.

[Read up](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51534616/how-to-change-package-name-in-flutter) on how to change a flutter package's name, or feel free to start a new flutter project and copy the useful files and folders, namely:
- `assets/*`
- `lib/*`
- `analysis_options.yml`
